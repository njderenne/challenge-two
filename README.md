## Application Description

I am a Full Stack Web Developer based out of Madison, WI. I started my journey as a Full Stack Developer working with Python creating programs to isolate specific patterns found within 3D arrays, that were input into the application by a user. These programs enabled solutions to problems astronomers were having working with radio data. This project resulted in a presentation at the American Astronomical Society Conference in Honolulu, HI. After I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I found a personal interest in Front End Software Development. I desired to work with a group of developers to fully immerse myself into Full Stack Software Engineering. I enrolled in the University of Wisconsin Extended Learning Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp to aid in the learning process.
